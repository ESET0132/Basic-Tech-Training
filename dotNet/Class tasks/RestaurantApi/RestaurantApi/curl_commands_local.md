## üìù NOTES:
- **`-k` flag**: Skips SSL certificate verification (needed for localhost HTTPS)
- **Replace tokens**: Copy the actual JWT tokens from login responses
- **Use HTTPS**: https://localhost:7052 (recommended)
- **Alternative HTTP**: http://localhost:5281 (if HTTPS issues, remove `-k` flag)

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING:

### If HTTPS doesn't work, try HTTP:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5281/api/restaurants"
```

### For verbose output (debugging):
```bash
curl -v -X GET "https://localhost:7052/api/restaurants" -k
```

### Save response to file:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://localhost:7052/api/restaurants" -k -o restaurants.json
```
